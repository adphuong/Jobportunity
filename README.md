## About The Project

<img src="./jobportunityScreenshot.png" />

Jobportunity is a web application that helps you organize your job search - Manage your job search all in one place and keep track of all your job applications and progress.

I wanted to build this tool not only to manage my internship search more easily, but to gain some experience working with the MERN stack as well.
